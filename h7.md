### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography

#### Chapter 2.3: One-Way Functions

- One-way functions are easy to compute but extremely difficult to reverse.
- Their difficulty lies in the fact that reversing them would take an impractical amount of time.
- The smashed plate analogy shows how easy it is to go one way, but not the other.
- There’s no mathematical proof that true one-way functions exist, only strong candidates.
- They seem one-way because no efficient method for reversing them is currently known.
- They can’t be used for direct encryption since the original message can’t be recovered.
- Trapdoor one-way functions include secret information that makes reversing possible, forming the basis for public-key cryptography.

#### Chapter 2.4: One-Way Hash Functions

- One-way hash functions, also called message digests or fingerprints, are key tools in modern cryptography.
- They convert variable-length input data into a fixed-length output called a hash value.
- The goal is to create a unique fingerprint that can verify data integrity without revealing the original input.
- A good one-way hash function is easy to compute but hard to reverse or find collisions for.
- Even a tiny change in the input drastically changes the output, making patterns impossible to spot.
- They’re often used to confirm data authenticity, like verifying files or preventing tampering in transactions.
- A Message Authentication Code (MAC) adds a secret key, allowing only authorized users to verify the hash.
