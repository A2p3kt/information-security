### Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

- Tor is sill active and it still works, and it has not been broken on a cryptographic layer. Most attacks are side channel attacks i.e. attacks on the environment where Tor is running, like the web browser, or simply because of human error
- Tor is far from being exclusively a tool for criminals. In reality, those seeking illegal activity often have easier options on the clear web. Tor serves a variety of legitimate purposes: activists rely on it to bypass censorship and protect their identities, militaries use it for secure communications, families use it to safeguard privacy, and journalists use it to research stories and communicate securely with sources.
- Tor has no military backdoor. Although its initial development was funded by the US Navy, the software is open source, audited by security experts, and maintained by a dedicated team of privacy-focused developers. This highlights the power of open source software.
- No one in the US has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay. While exit relays can attract law enforcement attention, running a relay is generally considered legal, and the Tor Project encourages responsible use.
- Tor is easy to use. The Tor Browser Bundle lets you browse securely out of the box, and Tails provides a live operating system that routes all Internet traffic through Tor while leaving no trace.
- Tor is faster than many expect. While slightly slower than a regular connection, ongoing improvements and adding more relays continue to speed up the network.
- Tor is not foolproof. Misuse, logging into personal accounts, or adversaries monitoring both ends of your connection can compromise anonymity, so it’s important to use Tor Browser or Tails and keep software updated.

This article really helped clear up common misconceptions about Tor. As a fun experiment, I fed the text into NotebookLM, and it generated a great, podcast-style summary. Feel free to check out the notebook and listen to it [here](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/15e7505d-ba1f-421f-ad7d-2b3c63c33424?artifactId=93c5dde0-7728-4d38-be72-df15e3350f1a)
