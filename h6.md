### Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

- Tor is sill active and it still works, and it has not been broken on a cryptographic layer. Most attacks are side channel attacks i.e. attacks on the environment where Tor is running, like the web browser, or simply because of human error
- Tor is far from being exclusively a tool for criminals. In reality, those seeking illegal activity often have easier options on the clear web. Tor serves a variety of legitimate purposes: activists rely on it to bypass censorship and protect their identities, militaries use it for secure communications, families use it to safeguard privacy, and journalists use it to research stories and communicate securely with sources.
- Tor has no military backdoor. Although its initial development was funded by the US Navy, the software is open source, audited by security experts, and maintained by a dedicated team of privacy-focused developers. This highlights the power of open source software.
- No one in the US has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay. While exit relays can attract law enforcement attention, running a relay is generally considered legal, and the Tor Project encourages responsible use.
- Tor is easy to use. The Tor Browser Bundle lets you browse securely out of the box, and Tails provides a live operating system that routes all Internet traffic through Tor while leaving no trace.
- Tor is faster than many expect. While slightly slower than a regular connection, ongoing improvements and adding more relays continue to speed up the network.
- Tor is not foolproof. Misuse, logging into personal accounts, or adversaries monitoring both ends of your connection can compromise anonymity, so it’s important to use Tor Browser or Tails and keep software updated.

This article really helped clear up common misconceptions about Tor. As a fun experiment, I fed the text into NotebookLM, and it generated a great, podcast-style summary. Feel free to check out the notebook and listen to it [here](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/15e7505d-ba1f-421f-ad7d-2b3c63c33424?artifactId=93c5dde0-7728-4d38-be72-df15e3350f1a)

### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: Chapter 2. The Tor Browser

#### Introduction

- Tor = “The Onion Router,” a network for anonymous communication.
- Created to protect users’ privacy online.
- Commonly used by journalists, activists, and also criminals.
- Helps hide user identity and activity.
- Focus: balance between privacy protection and criminal misuse.

#### History and Intended Use of the Onion Router

- Developed by U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (mid-1990s).
- Goal: secure government communications and protect intelligence sources.
- Released to public to increase anonymity through wider usage.
- Nonprofit Tor Project now manages development.
- Legitimate uses: privacy, freedom of speech, bypass censorship.
- Misuses: illegal trade, dark web activities.

#### How the Onion Router Works

- Based on onion routing (multiple layers of encryption).
- Data sent through three random nodes (relays):
  - Entry node (knows user)
  - Middle node (passes data)
  - Exit node (knows destination)
- Each layer decrypted step by step (like peeling an onion).
- No single relay knows both source and destination.
- Result: strong anonymity, difficult to trace.
- Downside: slower connection speed.

#### Tracking Criminals on TOR

- Difficult, not impossible.
- Investigators use:
  - Traffic analysis
  - Browser vulnerabilities (e.g. malware injection)
  - Human error (revealing identity accidentally)
- Cooperation with ISPs, hosting services, and Tor exit node monitoring.
- Example: FBI takedowns (e.g. Silk Road).
- Tor not foolproof — mistakes break anonymity.
- Law enforcement uses digital forensics + intelligence to uncover users.

## Installing TOR Browser and Accessing the TOR Network

### Installation

Installing the TOR browser was a very straight forward process. For context, the virtual machine environment was based on Debian 13 (Linux).
First as usual I ran `sudo apt-get update`, then I ran `sudo apt-get install torbrowser-launcher`. But then I got an error message along the lines `Package 'torbrowser-launcher' has no installation candidate`. This happened because my system didn't have access to the contrib repository, so I ran the command `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list` to see the repository list, then I added the word `contrib` to every line that did not start with `#` and I was left with something like:

Then I pressed `Ctrl + O` and then enter to save the changes.

I ran `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install torbrowser-launcher` again and the installation was successful. I then ran `torbrowser-launcher` to start the browser.
