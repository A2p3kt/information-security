# Kill Chain

## Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain

- Traditional tools like antivirus and intrusion detection focus only on fixing weaknesses (vulnerabilities).

- Old response methods assume an attack has already happened.

- Attackers have become more advanced, organized, and long-term — these are called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

- APTs target sensitive economic, business, or national security information.

- They use advanced tools and methods that can bypass normal security defenses.

- To fight them, defenders need an intelligence-driven approach (not just fixing vulnerabilities).

- This involves:

    - Using a kill chain model to understand each phase of an intrusion.
    - Mapping attacker actions to defender responses.
    - Finding patterns across multiple attacks to see larger campaigns.
    - Continuously gathering and using intelligence (feedback loop).
    - This approach makes future attacks less likely to succeed.

- It also helps organizations:
    - Use resources wisely.
    - Measure effectiveness of defenses.
    - Reduce both vulnerabilities and threats.

- A kill chain is a step-by-step process to carry out an attack.

- If any step fails, the whole attack can be stopped.

- For cyber intrusions, the kill chain has 7 phases:
    - Reconnaissance – Attackers gather information about the target (emails, social media, websites, technologies).
    - Weaponization – Attackers create a malicious payload (e.g., infected PDF or Word document) by combining malware with an exploit.
    - Delivery – Attackers send the weapon to the target, often via email attachments, malicious websites, or USB drives.
    - Exploitation – The weapon runs on the victim’s system, taking advantage of a vulnerability or tricking the user into executing it.
    - Installation – Malware (like a trojan or backdoor) is installed to maintain long-term access.
    - Command and Control (C2) – The compromised system connects back to the attacker’s server, giving them control of the victim machine.
    - Actions on Objectives – Attackers finally achieve their goals, usually stealing data, damaging systems, or using the system to spread further.
 
From this I understand that intelligence-driven defense is important because it allows defenders to anticipate attacks and reduce the likelihood of successful intrusions, rather than just reacting after an attack occurs. That way we are not sitting ducks waiting for an attack to happen before we do anything about it, we take a proactive approach rather than a reactive aproach.

## Tools, Tactics, and Procedures

### Tactics

A tactic represents the “why” behind an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It explains the attacker’s objective or purpose for taking a particular action. In other words, a tactic is the end goal.

For example, [Reconnaissance](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/), one of the steps in the intrusion kill chain, is a tactic. The attacker’s goal here is to gather information for future operations. All the different techniques and sub-techniques used to achieve this objective fall under the Reconnaissance tactic.

Another tactic is [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/) where the goal is to run malicious software on the the victim's system.

### Techniques and Sub-Techniques

Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action, while sub-techniques are a more specific description of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a goal. They describe behavior at a lower level than a technique.

Still on the reconnaisance example, an adversary may use a technique called [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/) to gather information about a target environment, such as identifying open ports or running services. A common sub-technique is [Vulnerability Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/002/), where the attacker checks if the configuration of a target host/application (ex: software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.

Thinking about execution, a famous technique that attackers might use is by [abusing command and script interpreters](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/) to execute commands, scripts or binaries on the victims computer. An equally famous sub-technique is [abusing the Powershell commands and scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/) to run malicious code on the victim's computer. This is because PowerShell is powerful and popular interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system.

### Procedures

Procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques.

An example of a procedure was [Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0030). Triton Safety Instrumented System Attack was a campaign employed by TEMP.Veles which leveraged the Triton malware framework against a petrochemical organization. The malware and techniques used within this campaign targeted specific Triconex Safety Controllers within the environment. The incident was eventually discovered due to a safety trip that occurred as a result of an issue in the malware.

Another example is the [2022 Ukraine Electric Power Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0025) where the Sandworm Team utilized a PowerShell utility called TANKTRAP to spread and launch a wiper using Windows Group Policy.
