# Kill Chain

## Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain

- Traditional tools like antivirus and intrusion detection focus only on fixing weaknesses (vulnerabilities).

- Old response methods assume an attack has already happened.

- Attackers have become more advanced, organized, and long-term — these are called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

- APTs target sensitive economic, business, or national security information.

- They use advanced tools and methods that can bypass normal security defenses.

- To fight them, defenders need an intelligence-driven approach (not just fixing vulnerabilities).

- This involves:

    - Using a kill chain model to understand each phase of an intrusion.
    - Mapping attacker actions to defender responses.
    - Finding patterns across multiple attacks to see larger campaigns.
    - Continuously gathering and using intelligence (feedback loop).
    - This approach makes future attacks less likely to succeed.

- It also helps organizations:
    - Use resources wisely.
    - Measure effectiveness of defenses.
    - Reduce both vulnerabilities and threats.

- A kill chain is a step-by-step process to carry out an attack.

- If any step fails, the whole attack can be stopped.

- For cyber intrusions, the kill chain has 7 phases:
    - Reconnaissance – Attackers gather information about the target (emails, social media, websites, technologies).
    - Weaponization – Attackers create a malicious payload (e.g., infected PDF or Word document) by combining malware with an exploit.
    - Delivery – Attackers send the weapon to the target, often via email attachments, malicious websites, or USB drives.
    - Exploitation – The weapon runs on the victim’s system, taking advantage of a vulnerability or tricking the user into executing it.
    - Installation – Malware (like a trojan or backdoor) is installed to maintain long-term access.
    - Command and Control (C2) – The compromised system connects back to the attacker’s server, giving them control of the victim machine.
    - Actions on Objectives – Attackers finally achieve their goals, usually stealing data, damaging systems, or using the system to spread further.

## Tools, Tactics, and Procedures

### Tactics

A tactic represents the “why” behind an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It explains the attacker’s objective or purpose for taking a particular action. In other words, a tactic is the end goal.

For example, Reconnaissance, one of the steps in the intrusion kill chain, is a tactic. The attacker’s goal here is to gather information for future operations. All the different techniques and sub-techniques used to achieve this objective fall under the Reconnaissance tactic.

### Techniques and Sub-Techniques

Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action, while sub-techniques are a more specific description of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a goal. They describe behavior at a lower level than a technique.

[Still on the reconnaisance example, one of the techniques an attacker might use to gain information is account discovery which entails getting a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email addresses on a system or within a compromised environment, which can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, and can aid in follow-on behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers.

A sub-technique that an adversary might use to discover accounts is by getting a listing of local system accounts. This will help them determine which local accounts exist on a system to aid in follow-on behavior.

### Procedures

Procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques.

An example of a procedure is [Agent Tesla](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331), a spyware Trojan written for the .NET framework
