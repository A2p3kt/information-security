## Reading Summaries

### Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- Cryptography basics: transforms plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using algorithms and secret keys.

- Kerckhoffsâ€™ Principle: system security must rely on secret keys, not on keeping algorithms secret.

- Symmetric cryptography: uses the same key for encryption and decryption; efficient but requires secure key exchange.

- Asymmetric cryptography: uses public/private key pairs; enables digital signatures and secure communication without prior key sharing.

- Cryptanalysis: study of breaking ciphers; modern ciphers are judged by their resistance to known attack types.

- Attack models: ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext, and chosen-ciphertext attacks.

- Confusion and diffusion: key design principles: obscure the link between key and ciphertext (confusion) and spread information widely (diffusion).

- Redundancy in language: natural patterns can help attackers; compression reduces redundancy before encryption.

- Steganography vs. cryptography: steganography hides the existence of a message, cryptography hides the content; best used together.

- Protocols and practicality: failures often arise from flawed cryptographic protocols or human errors, not from broken math; real security balances strength with usability.
