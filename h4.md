## OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

### Broken Access Control

  - Moved up from 5th place to first place in OWASP top 10 (2021)
  - Tested 94% of applications for some form of broken access control with an average incidence rate of 3.81%
  - It is simply the failure in enforcing access control policies, which can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or privilege escalation. 
  - Typical vulnerabilities include; violating least privilege, missing controls on API methods, CORS misconfiguration, insecure direct object references, etc.
  - Prevention strategies include; deny by default(least privilege), rate limit API, remove sensitive files from web roots, log access control failures, and alert admins when appropriate

### Security Misconfiguration

  - Jumped from #6 to #5 on the OWASP top 10(2021)
  - It means when servers, software, cloud services or apps are setup insecurely, or left at default settings creating "easy doors" for attackers to walk through.
  - 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration, with an average incidence rate of 4.51%
  - Common misconfigurations include; forgeting to harden certain parts of the app or cloud service, leaving default accounts/passwords unchanged, showing logs that are too detailed and might help attackers, running outdated software that has known vulnerabilities, etc.
  - Preventive strategies include; removing unused features/services to reduce attack surface, always sending security headers to clients, using automated tests to ensure that configurations stay secure overtime, regularly reviewing and updating configurations.

One comment I would make about this is how, in my opinion, cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, GCP) have seemed to make this worse by adding way too many configuration options, making it easy for an engineer to easily setup a service wrongly. But again attention to detail is one key requirement for security engineers, so yes, the environment might make things more complicated, but it is up to the human element to make sure that everything works as it should.

### Vulnerable and Outdated Components

  - This means using outdated, old, unsupported or unpatched third party components i.e. frameworks, libraries, APIs, databases, Operating Systems etc. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilties if any of these are used.
  - You are vulnerable if you:
      - Don't track component versions or dependencies
      - Don't patch or update regularly
      - Use unmaintained or abandoned libraries etc.
  - Preventive strategies include; having strong patch management services, downloading libraries or packages from the verified source, maintaining an ongoing update plan for the lifetime of the app.

I think one of the leading causes of this is the "set it and forget it" mentality that some developers have. They usually blindly trust a library or a package that worked once upon a time and don't look at it until something breaks or gets hacked.

### Injection

  - Dropped to #3 on the OWASP top 10(2021)
  - This happens when untrusted user data is mixed with queries or commands giving attackers the ability to change or interupt what a program does
  - The core of the problem is that data and code are not well separated.
  - The best way to detect if an application is vulnerable to this kind of attack is by reviewing the source code, also, automated testing of all inputs is strongly encouraged
  - Preventive strategies include; using safe APIs, validating user input, escape special characters properly for the interpreter, and avoid letting users supply structural parts of queries (like table/column names).

I'm suprised that although injection attacks are old, they are still very potent. It just goes to show the importance of implementing secure coding practices.
