## Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on Virtualbox - Updated 2024

- The article is a beginner friendly walkthrough on how to install a Debian Linux virtual machine on Virtualbox
- Debian can be installed inside VirtualBox to practice Linux safely without touching your real computer.
- You need to download the correct Debian ISO (live, version 12.x, amd64, and your chosen desktop environment such as XFCE).
- VirtualBox setup: create new VM → allocate memory (e.g., 4 GB) → allocate virtual hard disk (e.g., 60 GB, dynamically allocated).
- Insert ISO as virtual CDROM, boot the VM, and test with “Live” mode before installation.
- Install using Calamares installer: select language, location, keyboard, partitioning, create user, set password.
- After installation: update system (`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade`), enable firewall (`ufw`), reboot.
- Install VirtualBox Guest Additions to fix screen resolution and enable clipboard sharing.
- Optional troubleshooting: black screen fix with `xforcevesa`.
- **My thought:** This makes it easy to experiment with Linux without risking my main system. I wonder how much performance loss happens when running Debian in VirtualBox compared to bare metal.

## Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

- The Linux/Unix command line has existed for decades and remains fast, expressive, and easy to automate.
- **Moving and looking around:**
  - `pwd` shows the current working directory.
  - `ls` lists files in a directory.
  - `cd DIRNAME` changes directory; `cd ..` goes up one level.
  - `less FILE` lets you read files one page at a time; works with command output too (`ls /etc | less`).
- **File manipulation:**
  - `nano FILE` edits files; `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm` manage files and directories.
  - `rm -r` removes directories recursively (no trash → careful!).
- **Remote work:**
  - `ssh user@server` opens a secure remote shell.
  - `scp -r FOLDER user@server:path` securely copies files/folders to remote machines.
- **Help and discovery:**
  - `man COMMAND` and `COMMAND --help` show usage.
  - Tab autocompletion prevents typos and speeds up work.
  - `history` and `ctrl-R` search through past commands.
- **Important directories:**
  - `/` root of filesystem, `/home/` user directories, `/etc/` system configs, `/var/log/` logs.
- **Administration and software:**
  - Use `sudo` for system-wide tasks.
  - `apt-get update` refreshes package list; `apt-get install PKG` installs software.
  - Example: installing and later removing `nethack-console`.
- **My thought:** The article shows how a handful of commands can cover almost everything you need in Linux. I’d like to practice until I can rely on tab completion and history instead of retyping.
