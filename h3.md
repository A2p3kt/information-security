## Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on Virtualbox - Updated 2024

- The article is a beginner friendly walkthrough on how to install a Debian Linux virtual machine on Virtualbox
- Debian can be installed inside VirtualBox to practice Linux safely without touching your real computer.
- You need to download the correct Debian ISO (live, version 12.x, amd64, and your chosen desktop environment such as XFCE).
- VirtualBox setup: create new VM → allocate memory (e.g., 4 GB) → allocate virtual hard disk (e.g., 60 GB, dynamically allocated).
- Insert ISO as virtual CDROM, boot the VM, and test with “Live” mode before installation.
- Install using Calamares installer: select language, location, keyboard, partitioning, create user, set password.
- After installation: update system (`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade`), enable firewall (`ufw`), reboot.
- Install VirtualBox Guest Additions to fix screen resolution and enable clipboard sharing.
- **My thought:** This makes it easy to experiment with Linux without risking my main system. I wonder how much performance loss happens when running Debian in VirtualBox compared to bare metal.

## Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

- The Linux command line is old but powerful: fast, flexible, and scriptable.  
- Key commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `less`, `nano`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`.  
- Remote work: `ssh` for secure login, `scp` for file transfer.  
- Help: `man`, `--help`, tab completion, and `history`.  
- Important dirs: `/` (root), `/home/` (users), `/etc/` (configs), `/var/log/` (logs).  
- Admin tasks use `sudo` and package management (`apt-get`).   
- **My thought:** The article shows how a handful of commands can cover almost everything you need in Linux. I’d like to practice until I can rely on tab completion and history instead of retyping.

## Can't Fish

First I tested the connectivity when the network was enabled with `ping 1.1.1.1`
  - `ping` sends test packets to a target
  - `1.1.1.1` is Cloudfare's DNS Server
The response after terminated the ping was that all packets were received (0% loss), the average round-trip time was about **2.84 ms**, with minimal variation, showing a stable and responsive connection.

Then I disabled my network connection and ran the same command before, but this time the response was `ping: connect: Network is unreachable`
This response shows that the ping wasn't successful and no packets left the machine proving that the internet connection has been disabled.

## Port Scanning

First I ran the command `sudo apt-get install -y nmap`
  - `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser (admin) privileges, this is needed as installing software modifies system files.
  - `apt-get`: This is the package manager for Debian and it handles installing, updating and removing software packages.
  - `install`: This tells the package manager `apt-get` that you want to install a package
  - `-y`: Automatically answers yes to any confirmation prompts
  - `nmap`: The name of the package to be installed, in this case, Nmap, a popular network scanning and security auditing tool.

After doing that I disconnected from the internet and ran the command `sudo nmap -A localhost`
  - `sudo`: Runs command with superuser privileges
  - `nmap`: Runs the nmap tool for network scanning
  - `-A`: Enables aggressive scan mode, which makes Nmap gather extra information about the target, like the operating system, program versions, running services, and the network path.
  - `localhost`: The target to scan. `localhost` refers to my own computer

The response I got was:
``` bash
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000033s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
631/tcp open  ipp     CUPS 2.4
|_http-title: Home - CUPS 2.4.10
| http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry 
|_/
|_http-server-header: CUPS/2.4 IPP/2.1
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 2.6.X|5.X
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.32 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:5 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:6
OS details: Linux 2.6.32, Linux 5.0 - 6.2
Network Distance: 0 hops

OS and Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.78 seconds
```

The breakdown of this response is:
  - `localhost (127.0.0.1)`: The scan was run on my own computer
  - `Host is up (0.000033s latency)`: My machine responded almost immediately
  - `Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1`: My machine also has an  IPv6 address.
  - `Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports`: 999 TCP ports are closed.
  - `PORT 631/tcp open ipp CUPS 2.4`: Port 631 is open and running the CUPS 2.4 (Common Unix Printing System) printing service.
    - `http-title: Home - CUPS 2.4.10`: The web interface title of CUPS
    - `http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry`: There is a robots.txt file blocking web crawlers from one page
    - `http-server-header: CUPS/2.4 IPP/2.1`: The HTTP server header shows CUPS version and protocol
  - `Device type: general purpose`: Shows it is a standard computer.
  - `Running: Linux 2.6.X|5.X`: Nmap guessess what version of the Linux kernel my machine is running
  - `Network Distance: 0 hops`: The target is my own machine so no hops
  - The final paragraph is a summary that says that the scan is complete and a summary of all that was discovered, and also how long the scan took.

## Daemon

First I run `sudo apt-get install -y apache2` to install Apache, a web server.

Then I run `sudo systemctl start apache2`
  - `systemctl` is a tool to control programs that run in the background in Linux
  - `start apache2` tells the service mananger, `systemctl` to start running the web serer that I just installed.

I then run `sudo nmap -A localhost` to port scan my machine again and the result this time is:

``` bash
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000040s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp  open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.65 ((Debian))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.65 (Debian)
|_http-title: Apache2 Debian Default Page: It works
631/tcp open  ipp     CUPS 2.4
|_http-title: Home - CUPS 2.4.10
|_http-server-header: CUPS/2.4 IPP/2.1
| http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry 
|_/
Device type: general purpose
Running: Linux 2.6.X|5.X
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.32 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:5 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:6
OS details: Linux 2.6.32, Linux 5.0 - 6.2
Network Distance: 0 hops

OS and Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 7.90 seconds
```

In this, I notice that the number of TCP ports closed have reduced from 999, in the first scan, to 998, and in addition to the open port 631, port 80 is now open too and it is running a http service, it is running the web server that I started `Apache httpd 2.4.65 ((Debian))`
