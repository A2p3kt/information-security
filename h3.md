## Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on Virtualbox - Updated 2024

- The article is a beginner friendly walkthrough on how to install a Debian Linux virtual machine on Virtualbox
- Debian can be installed inside VirtualBox to practice Linux safely without touching your real computer.
- You need to download the correct Debian ISO (live, version 12.x, amd64, and your chosen desktop environment such as XFCE).
- VirtualBox setup: create new VM → allocate memory (e.g., 4 GB) → allocate virtual hard disk (e.g., 60 GB, dynamically allocated).
- Insert ISO as virtual CDROM, boot the VM, and test with “Live” mode before installation.
- Install using Calamares installer: select language, location, keyboard, partitioning, create user, set password.
- After installation: update system (`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade`), enable firewall (`ufw`), reboot.
- Install VirtualBox Guest Additions to fix screen resolution and enable clipboard sharing.
- **My thought:** This makes it easy to experiment with Linux without risking my main system. I wonder how much performance loss happens when running Debian in VirtualBox compared to bare metal.

## Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

- The Linux command line is old but powerful: fast, flexible, and scriptable.  
- Key commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `less`, `nano`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`.  
- Remote work: `ssh` for secure login, `scp` for file transfer.  
- Help: `man`, `--help`, tab completion, and `history`.  
- Important dirs: `/` (root), `/home/` (users), `/etc/` (configs), `/var/log/` (logs).  
- Admin tasks use `sudo` and package management (`apt-get`).   
- **My thought:** The article shows how a handful of commands can cover almost everything you need in Linux. I’d like to practice until I can rely on tab completion and history instead of retyping.

## Can't Fish

First I tested the connectivity when the network was enabled with `ping 1.1.1.1`
  - `ping` sends test packets to a target
  - `1.1.1.1` is Cloudfare's DNS Server
The response after terminated the ping was that all packets were received (0% loss), the average round-trip time was about **2.84 ms**, with minimal variation, showing a stable and responsive connection.

Then I disabled my network connection and ran the same command before, but this time the response was `ping: connect: Network is unreachable`
This response shows that the ping wasn't successful and no packets left the machine proving that the internet connection has been disabled.

## Port Scanning

First I ran the command `sudo apt-get install -y nmap`
  - `sudo`: Runs the command with superuser (admin) privileges, this is needed as installing software modifies system files.
  - `apt-get`: This is the package manager for Debian and it handles installing, updating and removing software packages.
  - `install`: This tells the package manager `apt-get` that you want to install a package
  - `-y`: Automatically answers yes to any confirmation prompts
  - `nmap`: The name of the package to be installed, in this case, Nmap, a popular network scanning and security auditing tool.

After doing that I disconnected from the internet and ran the command `sudo nmap -A localhost`
  - `sudo`: Runs command with superuser privileges
  - `nmap`: Runs the nmap tool for network scanning
  - `-A`: Enables aggressive scan mode, which makes Nmap gather extra information about the target, like the operating system, program versions, running services, and the network path.
  - `localhost`: The target to scan. `localhost` refers to my own computer

The response I got was:
``` bash
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000033s latency).
